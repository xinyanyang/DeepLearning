# DeepLearning
This repository contains HW and projects of IE 534 in 18 Fall and other deep learning materials.

**HW1**: Implement and train a neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). The neural network should be trained on the Training Set using stochastic gradient descent. It should achieve 97-98% accuracy on the Test Set.

**HW2**: Implement and train a convolution neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). You should write your own code for convolutions (e.g., do not use SciPyâ€™s convolution function). The convolution network should have a single hidden layer with multiple channels.

**HW3**: Train a deep convolution network on a GPU with PyTorch for the CIFAR10 dataset. The convolution network should use (A) dropout, (B) trained with RMSprop or ADAM, and (C) data augmentation. For 10% extra credit, compare dropout test accuracy (i) using the heuristic prediction rule and (ii) Monte Carlo simulation.

**HW4**: Build the Residual Network specified in Figure 1 and achieve at least 60% test accuracy./
     Fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet-18 model and achieve at least 70% test accuracy
     
**HW5**: Image Ranking Project

**HW6**: GAN Project

**HW7&HW8**: NLP Project
